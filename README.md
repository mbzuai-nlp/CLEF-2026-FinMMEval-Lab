# FinMMEval Lab @ CLEF 2026

Multilingual and multimodal evaluation of financial AI systems. The lab spans three complementary tasks and emphasizes evidence-grounded outputs with calibrated confidence.

## Tasks
- **Task 1 – Financial Exam Q&A:** Evaluates conceptual understanding and domain reasoning using multilingual, professional exam-style financial questions (e.g., CFA, CPA, EFPA, BBF). Performance is measured by accuracy.
- **Task 2 – Multilingual Financial Q&A:** Tests analytical financial reasoning using multilingual and multimodal information sources (e.g., SEC filings plus cross-lingual news). Models generate concise, evidence-grounded answers evaluated with ROUGE and factuality metrics.
- **Task 3 – Financial Decision Making:** Assesses reasoning-to-action by generating Buy/Hold/Sell decisions and short rationales from textual and numerical market contexts (BTC, TSLA). Evaluated via profitability, stability, and risk metrics (e.g., Sharpe Ratio, Cumulative Return).

## What to Submit
- Per-task prediction JSONL files with confidence scores.
- Evidence trace or rationale aligned to task definitions.
- System card (model design, data usage, risks) and reproducibility notes (seed, versions, hardware).
